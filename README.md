# MediTransfer-Warzone-Medical-Support


#Description

The Warzone Medical Record Transfer System is a client-server file transfer communication system designed to transmit medical records and critical information about injured soldiers in warzones. This system facilitates the sharing of electronic medical records between difficult medical facilities, saving time and improving patient outcomes. It also enables remote consultations with specialists who may not be physically present in the same location.

Additionally, the system helps manage medical supplies and equipment more efficiently when resources are limited. It provides a secure and password-protected communication system that encodes and decodes messages, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data.

This project is an integration of two previous projects: one that utilized the AANET protocol for communication and another that focused on communication and file transfer in hospitals. By combining these two projects and implementing them on Raspberry Pi, we have created a robust file transfer system that enhances situational awareness in warzones and enables coordinated actions among units.
